<p> I started my primary school studies at <i> Sekolah Kebangsaan St Bernadette's Convent, Batu Gajah, Perak </i>. I attended this school since I'm 7 years old until 12 years old. I've spent my whole childhood education here. This school is located about 12km from my home and I'd made really good memories in this school. </p>

<p> <i> Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Sultan Yussuf (SYS) </i> is a school where a lot of my memories are holds. I started moving to this school when I was 14 years old in 2011. I took arabic stream, which only consist of two classes for each level and I also lived in the school hostel. During upper secondary, I took science and I finished my SPM in 2014. I've learned a lot of things and have experienced so many memories during my high school years. </p>

<p> After finishing my school years,I furthered my diploma in Islamic Counselling at Kolej Universiti Sultan Azlan Shah (KUISAS). Most of my schoolmates also studied alongside with me here and it was a great experience. I've also joined many programmes under my university and made so many new friends. I graduated my diploma in 2018 </p>

<p> In 2019, I furthered my degree in TESL at Universiti Selangor (UNISEL). Unfortunately, due to some personal issues and the covid 19 outbreak, I wasn't able to proceed with my studies and quit. I've managed to finish three semesters and create some great memories, but at the time I believed there was better path for me ahead. </p>

<p> In 2021, I continued my degree in Information Science and Library Management at Uitm Merbok, Kedah until now. I didn't regret the choices I made in the past and I feel like I'm doing even better in my studies now and met so many good people and friends and people along the way. I hope to graduate my degree with excellent result </p>
